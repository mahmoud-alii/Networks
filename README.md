# Quiz-server_to_client
 Computer Networks Project - The Server has a question bank that consists of 10 questions, 
 and when a client connects to the server, the server sends 5 random questions.

To open a connection between the client and the server, 
run the server.py file and then run the client.py file or the client_GUI file at the same time.

Enjoy!
